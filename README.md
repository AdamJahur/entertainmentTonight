# entertainmentTonight
Entertainment Tonight allows you to search for live entertainment events by geographic area.  Upon choosing an area, you are presented with a sortable list of venues and events.  Clicking on a given event brings up a presentation about the peformer/event.  Finally, the app has an event/venue review feature, stored in Firebase. 

The purpose is to allow individuals to find entertainment (eg, music) events in their area, and to find out more information about performers they've never seen or heard, or venues they've never previously visited.
